                        <h2>Supplier User Services</h2>
                        <p>
                        FIROGMRAM website services include providing a Business to Business (B2B) marketplace with the ability to: (1) create "service requests" or "Request for Quote" or "RFQ" which refers to the proposing of a sum of money in exchange for a business service or products; (2) the ability to issue a quote for the requested service; and (3) facilitate communications between service buyers and service providers. 

                        <h2>Issuing a Service Request or RFQ</h2>
                        <p>
                        Placing a service request or RFQ does not mean entering into a binding legal Agreement with the service suppliers. The requests, however, have to be posted in accordance with the terms stated in the item listing and the rules of this website. Offers are an irrevocable proposal to buy the service at the price of the offer, provided it is accepted at the close of the time period suggested in the request form. After your offer details are posted to the website and thus sent to the suppliers, you will not be able to amend your description of the parameters until the offer has either been accepted, rejected or expires. Supplier have less than seven (7) days to issue quotes and buyer have 48-hour time limits accept (or reject)  a quote. If buyer opt to not take action on a quote, it will be deemed expired after the 48-hour period elapses. Upon acceptance of the quote, any failure by a service buyer or service supplier to honour the terms set forth in the creation of RFQ can result in the disapproval, curtailing or terminating of your use of the website at any time. If your offer is accepted by the service supplier, your purchase may not be retracted without permission.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Issuing Quotes or Offer of Services</h2>
                        <p>Service suppliers can purchase the right to issue quotes in accordance with the terms stated in the item listing and the rules of this website. Do not issue quotes until you are sure that you understand the full terms and requirement stated in the buyer service request. Purchasing a right to quote on RFQs are in form of a "Pay-per-quote" or "Membership Subscriptions" as defined in suppliers' dashboard. Issuing a quote does not constitute your acceptance to entering into a binding legal agreement with the service buyer. Once a quote is issued and corresponding charges are deducted, it may not be cancelled or retracted without permission. The buyer is not obligated to grant permission to retract or cancel a quote, and it is not the duty of this website to request permission for a purchase retraction or cancellation. Any quotation and terms therein must be worked out between the service buyers and service suppliers with or without assistance from the FIRMOGRAM. By purchasing a subscription or "Pay Per Quote" credits, service suppliers authorize us to release their contact information that only include  first name, business name, and address to the buyers  who requested the service.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Communication Between Users</h2>
                            <p>The buyer identity is not revealed to the supplier until they choose to do for the quote that has been offered by the supplier. After buyer issues a request or RFQ and upon approval from FIRMOGRAM, an email is sent to the relevant suppliers by revealing your first name only. As soon as supplier issues a quote, the identity of supplier is revealed to the buyer in form of their first name, last name initial, and business name and business website if applicable. Moreover buyer is able to view suppliers profile from "Suppliers Directory" link. The extent of information for each supplier in our website is depending on their type of subscription and willingness to provide more details about their services and products they offer. We, however, obliged suppliers to provide basic information about the name, location, website and category of their services or products. Upon receiving a quote from supplier, buyers and suppliers are responsible for contacting each other via their dashboard and by utilizing our messaging system to discuss specifics about the requested service. It is not our responsibility to arrange delivery of the service. Failure by you to honour good practice of the communication in a business professional manner may result in temporary or indefinite suspension from FIRMOGRAM.
                        </p>
                        
                        <h2> Other User Responsibilities and Duties </h2>
                        <p>You shall not circumvent, avoid, obviate, or bypass us, directly or indirectly, with regard to any transaction to avoid payment of fees and/or commissions in any transactions with the buyer and/or any corporation, entity, partnership, sole proprietorship, limited liability company/corporation, or individual in connection with any request or RFQ relating to the FIRMOGRAM website. We request that you alert us to any actions that interfere with the integrity of our service. If you suspect illegal activities, price or offer manipulation, fraud or multiple identities, it is important to provide us with this information immediately.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Buyer Right of Refusal</h2>
                            <p>
                            Service Suppliers understand and agree that a service buyer may refuse any quote at any time. This Right of Refusal exists as to all types of transactions on our website. Once supplier issues a quote, the buyer may exercises its Right of Refusal and you can not request FIRMOGRAM for a refund. We have unique refund policies and in exceptional circumstances that refund is possible, you may not be issued a full refund. Although a buyer may refuse quotes after initial acceptance, FIRMOGRAM recommends buyers exercise this right prudently. For more information on refunds, please contact us at info@firmogram.com or +1 855 782 6882.
                            </p>
